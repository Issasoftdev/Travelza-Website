# Travelza-Website

March 2021

A travel website I created for a school project:

For this project I had to create this website's interface from a mock-up that was provided, using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

What I learned from this project:

- HTML DOM
- CSS Layouts - Positioning | Flexbox | Grid
- Responsive Web Design
- Mobile-first approach to development
- Javascript:
    - Callback Functions[Arrow Functions], querySelector(), getElementbyID(), addEventListener() 
    - Manipulating CSS Styles in Javascript by targeting the classList property.
